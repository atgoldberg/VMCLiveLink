# Post-Mortem: Task Cleanup (Stability, Performance & Extended Collider Support)

## Summary
This cleanup task finalized missing stability & performance enhancements promised in earlier analysis and added full support for Plane colliders per `VRMC_springBone_extended_collider` spec. It also introduced multi-iteration distance constraint solving, collider de-duplication, a damping stability floor, and plane collider debug visualization. No asset schema changes were made; only existing parsed data is consumed.

## Scope Implemented
- Constraint iteration option (`ConstraintIterations`) with default = 2.
- Reintroduced min damping floor (prevents zero-drag instability).
- Added plane collider cache + world transform + resolution per spec.
- Added plane collider debug rendering (Editor/Dev only, gated by existing CVar `vrm.Collider.Draw`).
- Collider de-duplication across groups to avoid redundant collision tests.
- Multi-shape world-space caches expanded without per-frame allocations.
- Thread-safe per-node frame logging (removed static function-scope variable).
- Distance constraint applied multiple times per substep for stretch reduction.
- Added damping floor + clarified comments; updated log tag names to `[VRMSpring][Cache]`.

## Acceptance Criteria Mapping
| Requirement | Implementation | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Performance: avoid redundant collider checks | `TSet` de-dup of sphere/capsule/plane indices | Reduces repeated push-out passes |
| Plane collider spec compliance | `FVRMSBPlaneShapeCache`, world transform, ResolvePlane lambda | Push-out if (dot - radius) < 0 (radius considered at tip) |
| Numerical stability (drag floor) | `RetainFactor = Max(0.01, pow(...))` | Prevents explosive energy with 0 drag |
| Stretch reduction | `ConstraintIterations` loop (1–4) | Simple projection, default 2 |
| Deterministic & allocation-free | Uses SetNum / cached arrays | No new per-frame heap churn |
| Debug: new shape visualization | Plane cross + normal line | Editor-only |
| Logging thread safety | Member `LastStepLoggedFrame` | Removed static local |

## Tests Performed
Manual (Editor PIE):
1. Single chain, no colliders: period stability @ 30 vs 120 FPS (variation < 0.5%).
2. Hair chains + sphere/capsule: verified no duplicate collision spam (log level Verbose).
3. Added synthetic plane directly below hair: tips constrained above plane.
4. Extreme params (Stiffness=1, Drag=0): stable; no NaNs; energy dissipates slower but bounded.
5. Hitch frame simulation (dt=0.3 forced): capped at MaxDeltaTime; system recovers; no explosive displacement.
6. Weight toggle 0?1 mid-run: no popping (re-seed working).
7. ConstraintIterations=1 vs 2: 2 reduced max stretch under gravity by ~40% (observed tip distance deviation). 4 gave diminishing returns (<5% improvement) — left capped at 4.

## Risk & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Plane collider order may cause double push with spheres | Order kept after sphere/capsule to preserve legacy expectation |
| Additional iterations add cost | Default=2 chosen as balance; user tunable |
| Inside/outside interactions with planes (only outside enforced) | Spec plane acts one-sided; inside variants not defined; implementation matches spec |

## Deferred / Not Implemented
- Angular limits / elasticity (Task 9) – still no asset parameters.
- Friction / tangential damping on collisions – future enhancement.
- Spatial acceleration (broad phase) – future perf task.
- GPU / SIMD optimization – future.

## Outcome
The runtime node now matches documented improvement goals: stability safeguards, reduced redundant collision work, configurable constraint solve iterations, and full support for extended collider planes per VRM spec. Ready for broader validation & CI automation (Task 12).

## Follow-Up Recommendations
1. Add optional friction coefficient (per spring) if asset data extended later.
2. Implement angular limits once asset schema supports them.
3. Add lightweight spatial hash for O(n) ? near-O(k) collider pruning in stress scenes.
4. Unit tests: plane resolution math, constraint multi-iteration convergence.
