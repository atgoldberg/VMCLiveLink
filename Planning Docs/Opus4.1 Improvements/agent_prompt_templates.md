## Implementation Requirements

### Code Standards
1. Follow Epic Games' Unreal Engine C++ coding standards
2. Use Unreal's memory management systems (no raw new/delete)
3. Employ UPROPERTY/UFUNCTION macros appropriately
4. Maintain thread safety where applicable
5. Use FMath functions for mathematical operations
6. Prefer TArray over std::vector, FString over std::string

### VRM Compliance Requirements
1. Exactly match the mathematical algorithms from the VRM specification
2. Properly convert between glTF coordinate system (Y-up, right-handed) and Unreal (Z-up, left-handed)
3. Maintain compatibility with both VRM 0.x and VRM 1.0 formats
4. Ensure behavior consistency with UniVRM reference implementation

### Performance Considerations
1. Minimize per-frame allocations
2. Use cache-friendly data structures
3. Implement SIMD optimizations where beneficial
4. Consider parallel processing for independent operations
5. Profile changes to ensure no performance regression

### Testing Requirements
1. Test with at least 3 different VRM models (provided in test_assets/)
2. Verify no visual artifacts or animation glitches
3. Ensure backward compatibility with existing assets
4. Validate memory usage and performance metrics
5. Test edge cases (zero bones, many colliders, etc.)

### Documentation Requirements
1. Add comprehensive comments for complex algorithms
2. Document any deviations from the specification with reasoning
3. Update function headers with parameter descriptions
4. Include usage examples where appropriate

- Document any challenges encountered
- Note any remaining issues
- Provide rollback instructions

## Deliverables

3. Test results and performance metrics
4. Any new unit tests created
5. Updated documentation

## Constraints and Warnings
- DO NOT modify the public API without explicit approval
